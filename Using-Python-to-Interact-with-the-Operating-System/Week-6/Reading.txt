Bash Scripting

Basic Linux Commands
    ls,mkdir,cd,echo,chmod,pwd,cp,touch,ls -l,ls -al,ls -la,mv,rm,rm *,cd ..,rmdir
    Example: cp ../filename .
Redirecting Streams
    Redirection is a process of sending a stream to a different destination.

    >(overwite)
    >>(append)
    2>(redirect error t sepearte file)

    ./Test.py > TestOutputFile.txt # store output in file instead printing on terminal
    echo "this text will be written to this file" > theFile.txt

Pipes and Pilelines
    Pipes
        Pipes connect the output of one program to the input of another. This means we can pass data between programs, taking the output of one and making it the input of the next.
        i.e.,
            ls -l | less
            cat input.txt | ./test.py               # send content of input file to the test file
           
            cat sample.txt | tr ' ' '\n' | sort     
            # The contents of the txt file are passed on to be placed in their own line and sorted in alphabetical order on the display.

            grep
            ping

Signalling Processes
    Signal:
        Signals are tokens delivered to running processes to indicate a desired action
        Ctrl + c
        Ctrl + z
        fg #run once more
        ps # list current proces
        ps ax # all running process
        ps ax | grep ping       # get (PID, process ID) of runnig process
        kill PID        # kill process with that process id (PID)

Conditional Execution in Bash
    if grep "...condition..."; then
        # execute this
    else
        # execute this
    fi #ending line

    # or this way
    if test -n "$PATH"; then echo "IS"; fi
    if [ -n "$PATH" ]; then echo "ISSF"; fi

    cut #commnad
     tail /var/log/syslog | cut -d' ' -f3-
