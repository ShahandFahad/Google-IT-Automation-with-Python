Github: Distributed System

GitHub provides free access to a Git server for public and private repositories.

The git push command gathers all the snapshots we've taken and sends them to the remote repository.

git push 
git pull
git clone


What is remote?
    ---------

If there are pending changes in the master branch, Git will let you know.



command: git remote show origin

Fetching:
git fetch fetches remote updates but doesn't merge; git pull fetches remote updates and merges.

Merge Master: git merge origin/master


git fetch and git merge:--> git pull

Fast Forward: 
    As long as there are no conflicts, Git will move the current branch tip up to the target branch tip and combine histories of both commits.



Git Rebase: 
    What does “git rebase refactor” do?
    Move the current branch on top of the refactor branch
    
    This makes debugging easier and prevents three-way merges by transferring the completed work from one branch to another.

    Resbase is used to keep history linear... avoid 3 way merge
    and don not go into branching.

     Rebasing instead of merging rewrites history and maintains linearity, making for cleaner code
