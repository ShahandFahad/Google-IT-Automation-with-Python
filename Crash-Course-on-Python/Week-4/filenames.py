Question 1
Given a list of filenames, we want to rename all the files with extension hpp to the extension h. To do this, we would like to generate a new list called newfilenames, consisting of the new filenames. Fill in the blanks in the code using any of the methods youâ€™ve learned thus far, like a for loop or a list comprehension.
"""
filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp",
             "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]
# Generate newfilenames as a list containing the new filenames
# using as many lines of code as your chosen method requires.
newfilenames = []
for filename in filenames:
    filetitle, fileextension = filename.split('.')
    if (fileextension == 'hpp'):
        newfilenames.append(filetitle + '.' + 'h')
    else:
        newfilenames.append(filename)

print(newfilenames)
# Should be ["program.c", "stdio.h", "sample.h", "a.out", "math.h", "hpp.out"]
