Maniging Resources

    In this module, you’ll learn how to manage your applications. You’ll dive into some common issues that may cause your application to crash. You’ll also understand what memory leaks are, and how to troubleshoot and prevent them. Up next, you’ll run down managing disk space; you’ll see some scenarios of how this happens and how to identify what process or application is taking up all your disk space. Then, you'll learn what network saturation is, how it can be caused, and some useful tools and techniques to solve a network saturation problem. Next, we’ll shift from managing applications to managing your time. You’ll get tips on how to prioritize tasks, estimate how long a particular task will take before finishing, and communicate expectations when dealing with important tasks. The final lesson delves into how to deal with hard and complex problems by breaking it down into small, digestible chunks while keeping your eyes on a clear goal. You’ll learn that using proactive approaches, like continuous integration, can help you with future issues that might come up. You’ll also explore how to plan for future resource usage by making good use of monitoring.

Managing Computer Resources
    Memory leak
        A memory leak, happens when a chunk of memory that's no longer needed is not released. 

        An app that still needs a lot of memory, even after a restart, most likely points to a memory leak.  

     Garbage collector
        Garbage collector that's in charge of freeing the memory that's no longer in use.

 Large temporary files may remain if an application crashes because it’s not cleaned up automatically.  

Latency
    The latency is the delay between sending a byte of data from one point and receiving it on the other. 

Bandwidth
    The bandwidth is how much data can be sent or received in a second.

Traffic shaping
    This is a way of marking the data packets sent over the network with different priorities. 

    
There are limits to how many connections a single server can have, which will prevent new connections.
