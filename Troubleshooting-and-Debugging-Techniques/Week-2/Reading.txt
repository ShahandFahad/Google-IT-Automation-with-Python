Slowness

Understanding Slowness

    The bottleneck could be the CPU time, or time spent reading data from disk.

Cache
     Cache stores data in a form that's faster to access than its original form.
Memory Leak
     A memory leak means that memory which is no longer needed is not getting released.


A program keeping a state without any change can slow down a computer up until it is rebooted. 

Slow Code
    Profilers:
        A profiler is a tool that measures the resources that our code is using, giving us a better understanding of what's going on.
    cProfile:
        The cProfile module is used to count how many times functions are called, and how long they run.

When Slow Problem Complex
    A script is CPU bound if you're running operations in parallel using all available CPU time.  

    Executor
    This is the process that's in charge of distributing the work among the different workers.

    Future Modules  
    The futures module provides a couple of different executors, one for using threads and another for using processes. 

    The futures module makes it possible to run operations in parallel using different executors.
