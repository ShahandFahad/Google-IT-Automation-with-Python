Managing Cloud Instance at Scale    
    In this module, you’ll learn all about storing data in the cloud. You’ll rundown the different types of storage available, like block storage and object storage, and how they differ. You’ll explore load balancing further and dive into some load balancing techniques, like round-robin DNS and sticky sessions. Next, you’ll dive into change management, including the different ways to test your changes and how to push them. You’ll explore different testing methods, like unit tests and integration tests. You’ll also cover continuous integration, the use of continuous deployment, and how to apply A/B testing. Next up, you’ll look at some errors you might encounter along the way, like quotas or limits, and how best to avoid or prepare for these. In the next lesson, you’ll get an understanding of monitoring and altering, and review some systems that offer it. You’ll then dive into the concept of SLA’s and how to set achievable ones. Next, you’ll look at basic monitoring in GCP, and create altering policies, set up conditions, and choose aggregators to manage the data. The last lesson will explore troubleshooting and debugging our systems. You’ll learn how to troubleshoot and debug remotely, understand. techniques for how to identify where the failure is coming from, and how to recover from a failure when it strikes.

    Storing Data in the Cloud
        Block storage
        Object Storage  
        Blob Storage      
    Ephemeral vs Block Storage
        Our block storage can be either persistent or ephemeral. Persistent storage is used for instances that are long lived, and need to keep data across reboots and upgrades. On the flip side, ephemeral storage is used for instances that are only temporary, and only need to keep local data while they're running. Ephemeral storage is great for temporary files that your service needs to create while it's running, but you don't need to keep.

    Load balancing
        Techniques
            Round Robin DNS
                The Round-robin approach serves clients one at a time, starting with the first, and making rounds until it reaches the beginning again.
        Sticky sessions
            Using sticky sessions means all requests from the same client always go to the same back end server
        CDN's
            There are some providers dedicated to bringing the contents of your services as close to the user as possible. These are the content delivery networks or CDNs. They make up a network of physical hosts that are geographically located as close to the end user as possible.
        Change Management
            If we want to fix bugs and improve features in our services, we have to make changes. But we can make changes in a controlled and safe way. This is called change management, and it's what lets us keep innovating while our services keep running.
        Continuous integration
            ontinuous Integration means the software is built, uploaded, and tested constantly.
        
        Understanding Limitations
            Rate limits
                Cloud providers will often enforce rate limits on resource-hungry service calls to prevent one service from overloading the entire system.

        Environment
            Everything used to run the service is referred to as the environment. This includes the machines and networks used for running the service, the deployed code, the configuration management, the application configurations, and the customer data.
        Latency
            Latency is the amount of time it takes to complete a read or write operation.
