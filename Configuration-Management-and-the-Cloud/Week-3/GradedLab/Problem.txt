Create VM template and Automate deployment

Introduction
    You're an IT Administrator for your company and you're assigned to work on a project that requires you to deploy eight virtual machines (VMs) as web servers. Each of them should have the same configuration. You'll create a VM, set up an auto-enabled service, and make it a template. Then you'll use the template to create seven more VMs.

What you'll do
    Create a VM using GCP web UI and make a template out of it

    Use a command-line interface to interact with VMs

    Learn how to configure an auto-enabled service

    Learn to use gcloud to deploy VMs with a template


1. Create a VM instance from the Cloud Console

   Git clone
        Use Git to clone the repository by using the following command:

            git clone https://www.github.com/google/it-cert-automation-practice.git
     
        File operation
            Once you have the repository successfully cloned, navigate to the Lab3/directory.

                cd ~/it-cert-automation-practice/Course5/Lab3
        
        To list the files in the working directory Lab3/ use the list command.

                ls 
        
        In order to enable hello_cloud.py to run on boot, copy the file hello_cloud.py to the /usr/local/bin/ location.

                sudo cp hello_cloud.py /usr/local/bin/
        
        Also copy hello_cloud.service to the /etc/systemd/system/ location.

                sudo cp hello_cloud.service /etc/systemd/system
        
        Now, use the systemctl command to enable the service hello_cloud.

                sudo systemctl enable hello_cloud.service
        

2. Restart the VM
3. Create VMs using a template
4. Through Command line
    Now, you'll create new VM instances with the template named vm1-template from your local computer using gcloud command-line interface. To do this, return back to the command line interface on your local computer, and enter the following command:

        gcloud compute instances create --zone us-west1-b --source-instance-template vm1-template vm2 vm3 vm4 vm5 vm6 vm7 vm8
    
    Wait for the command to finish. Once it's done, you can view the instances through the Console or by using the following gcloud command on your local terminal:

        gcloud compute instances list
    
    Now, open the external links for vm2 and vm8 to check if all the configuration set up properly as vm1.
